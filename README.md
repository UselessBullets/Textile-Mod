--VERY EARLY WIP--

mod that aims to add cotton and various cotton derived materials to BTA.
currently implemented:
cotton item, currently unobtainable
cotton gin, obtainable once i get these damn recipes working
cotton seeds, currently useless
cotton thread, crafts into cotton wool and string
cotton wool, currently just a useless wool recolour
feel free to download and mess around with it if its not broken, which it probably is
